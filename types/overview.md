An attempt to create a vocabulary of exercise types than can be shared across services that are concerned with exercises (i.e., physical activities such as hiking, walking, running, or cycling).

* [Active Activity Distribution API](API/Active.md) (25 exercise types)
* [Adidas miCoach API](API/miCoach.md) (33 exercise types)
* [Apple HealthKit](API/applehealthkit.md) (57 exercise types)
