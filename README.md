Exercise Data
=============

This is an attempt to bring some interoperability to the world of exercise data. The format and the information listed here is constantly evolving and driven by the needs of bringing together data that originates in data and services provided by fitbands, GPS watches, or smartphone apps.

While in the long run this might evolve into something a bit more sophisticated, for now the main goal is to be simple to use and evolve. Therefore, the format uses CSV and some very simple ways of representing metadata.
