Exercise Types
==============

An attempt to create a vocabulary of exercise types than can be shared across services that are concerned with exercises (i.e., physical activities such as hiking, walking, running, or cycling).

So far the following 8 APIs (with a total of 401 exercise types) have been taken into consideration:

* [Apple HealthKit](applehealthkit.md) (57 exercise types)
* [Athlete.com API](athlete.com.md) (11 exercise types)
* [Google Fit](googlefit.md) (111 exercise types)
* [Health Graph API](healthgraph.md) (32 exercise types)
* [Moves API](moves.md) (74 exercise types)
* [NikeFuel](nikefuel.md) (84 exercise types)
* [Sony Lifelog API](sony-lifelog.md) (4 exercise types)
* [Strava V3](strava-v3.md) (28 exercise types)
