Exercise Types
==============

An attempt to create a vocabulary of exercise types than can be shared across services that are concerned with exercises (i.e., physical activities such as hiking, walking, running, or cycling).

So far the following 10 APIs (with a total of 435 exercise types) have been taken into consideration:

* [Active Activity Distribution API](Active.md) (25 exercise types)
* [Apple HealthKit](applehealthkit.md) (57 exercise types)
* [Athlete.com API](athlete.com.md) (11 exercise types)
* [Flexible and Interoperable Data Transfer Protocol (FIT)](FIT.md) (9 exercise types)
* [Google Fit](googlefit.md) (111 exercise types)
* [Health Graph API](healthgraph.md) (32 exercise types)
* [Moves API](moves.md) (74 exercise types)
* [NikeFuel](nikefuel.md) (84 exercise types)
* [Sony Lifelog API](sony-lifelog.md) (4 exercise types)
* [Strava V3](strava-v3.md) (28 exercise types)
