Exercise Data Format (EDF)
==========================

A simple, extensible, and open data format for representing exercise data based on timestamps. It is based on CSV and thus the following two RFCs might be helpful when using it:

* [RFC 4180: Common Format and MIME Type for Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Files](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180)
* [RFC 7111: URI Fragment Identifiers for the text/csv Media Type](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7111)

So far the following 2 fields have been defined:

HR: Heartrate
----------

...

time: Timestamp
----------

[Internet Timestamps (RFC 3339)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339)
